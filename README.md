# ABOUT
This is a project done at UC Berkeley under the supervision of the Berkeley Institute of Data Science. This is an android app demo created to explore the usage of image recognition and AR in the product displays. 

The app was created using Vulforia technology.


# LOG OF WORK 
## Week 1 (10/2/2016)
### Past Week
I spent 3-4 hours just doing the initial set up. Setting up Android Studio, Android SDK/NDK, Unity, and Vulforia. I spent a lot of time looking at tutorials and looking through documentation to understand Vulforia. The easiest way to work with Vulforia is through Unity in my opinion. But there are provided sample apps that cover nearly all of the functionality one would need for an AR app. But when loading the sample apps, I had to spend another hour or so just debugging my set up. In the end I got the sample app to work on my phone which I won't push to gitHub since I didn't write any of the code there. I also followed the tutorial through Unity, but that's not really Android specific and generates an APK.

### Next Week 
Ideally, I would like to make modifications to the sample app and branch off from it. I need to look more at the samples and their use of the Java API. I don't understand the code well enough. 

### Outstanding Issues: 
- VuMark generation process is not trivial (requires Adobe Illustrator)
- Haven't delved into Unity enough to be comfortable, Unity has limitations for Native Android
- I don't know any C++

## Week 2 (10/9/2016)
### Past Week
Picked apart the demo app. Two versions. One uses Image Target and an imported device database. The other is the Cloud one, I haven't gotten that working yet. 
### Next Week
Change the 3D-image according to the tracker. Create OpenGL text mesh to overlay. 
### Outstanding Issues:
- Lots of reading code. Not really any good guides on specific things.  

## Week 3 and 4 (10/16/2016 and 10/23/2016)
###Past Week
Got api calls to work but not correct calls.
### Next Week
Change the 3D-image according to the tracker.
### Outstanding Issues:
- Need to refactor code (remove unnecessary code)
- Get product id
- Fix image loads

## Finished
- Polished the UI
- Finished MVP and assisted with iPhone development
