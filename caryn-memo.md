#Caryn's Memos
##Week 1 (10/2/2016)
###Past Week
I spent 3-4 hours just doing the initial set up. Setting up Android Studio, Android SDK/NDK, Unity, and Vulforia. I spent a lot of time looking at tutorials and looking through documentation to understand Vulforia. The easiest way to work with Vulforia is through Unity in my opinion. But there are provided sample apps that cover nearly all of the functionality one would need for an AR app. But when loading the sample apps, I had to spend another hour or so just debugging my set up. In the end I got the sample app to work on my phone which I won't push to gitHub since I didn't write any of the code there. I also followed the tutorial through Unity, but that's not really Android specific and generates an APK.

###Next Week 
Ideally, I would like to make modifications to the sample app and branch off from it. I need to look more at the samples and their use of the Java API. I don't understand the code well enough. 

###Outstanding Issues: 
- VuMark generation process is not trivial (requires Adobe Illustrator)
- Haven't delved into Unity enough to be comfortable, Unity has limitations for Native Android
- I don't know any C++
